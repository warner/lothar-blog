Title: Git over Tahoe-LAFS

!BEGIN-SUMMARY!
Tahoe-LAFS provides reliability, integrity, and confidentiality, so you
can store important data safely across multiple servers. Git provides
version control and merge tools, enabling better coordination between
multiple authors. By using Tahoe as a Git backend, we can get both.
!END-SUMMARY!

Tahoe's main API looks a lot like an FTP server: you can
add/replace/remove whole files, and manage directories.
